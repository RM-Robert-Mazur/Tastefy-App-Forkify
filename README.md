# üç≤ Tastefy Project - Forkify üç≤

Tastefy is a recipe search app based on 'forkify' API made by Jonas Schmedtmann. This small app allows the user to search for a recipe by their name or ingredients. We can also add a custom recipe to the system which later can be retrieved from the API database.

Additionally, the user is also to bookmark his favourite recipes by simply clicking a button. Bookmarks are stored in the local storage. At any given moment the user can delete any bookmark entries by unchecking the favourite button placed next to the recipe.

This app is the final project which I built throughout my JavaScript course. For the past 2 years I have mainly focused myself on SEO aspects. However, this year I have decided to come back to my roots and remind myself all of the fundamentals/advance specifics that I have learnt at my university as the frontend developer. So please bear in mind that this project mainly focuses on JavaScript ‚Äì so at this moment the styling of the website is only focused on desktop browsers.
